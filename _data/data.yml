    summary: |
      I have been in the aviation industry with Envoy for 3 years. I
      started as an part-time crossfunctional station agent. I gained
      experience during a six month temporary duty assignment in Kalispell, Montana.
      During that assignment, I was promoted to a supervisor position in
      Killeen-Fort Hood, Texas where I learned the management side of the industry.
